# Mozilla HTTP Observatory :: Website

The Mozilla HTTP Observatory is a set of tools to analyze your website and inform you if you are utilizing the many available methods to secure it.

It is split into three projects:

* [http-observatory](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory) - scanner/grader
* [http-observatory-cli](https://github.com/mozilla/observatory-cli) - command line interface
* [http-observatory-website](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory-website) - web interface

TLS evaluation relies on external scanners, such as Mozilla's [TLS Observatory](https://github.com/mozilla/tls-observatory).
